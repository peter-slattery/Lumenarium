- Plasma Ray - light from primary city out to secondary splash
x Connection Pattern - fill part up with light, have the empty space do the data flow pattern
- Spatially Vertical Rain (not spherical)
- Something like rain for data viz

- Rendering gifs to the secondary cities


Anyone Home
- some light, but low power mode
- blues, match screen - guide person towards display

Welcome Home 
- keep the secondary cities off

Felt Isolated - blues, cooler tones, water?

Nature - gold, pink/purple - drinking champagne - carousel colors
- bluring the ends of bars is ok, just keep it consistent

For data sets that have really high values everywhere, grow them in one at a time
- for connection based ones: grow first, ripple out secondary cities to the next nearest primary city, grow that one

QUESTION: Are we showing a statement about the data during the passive mode of each scene?
- Yes

QUESTION: Can we change the scene ids? Does it matter if two screens have the same sceneId?

TODO: Put together an ending scene
