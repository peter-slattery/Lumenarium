TODO FOLDHAUS

YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF


BUGS
- Typing a period into a float value doesn't register. Problem here is that we arent' translating key presses into characters at the win32 layer. Need to do that.

Switch To Nodes
- delete nodes
-  - Simplify node storage
-     - separate storage of node headers from connections
-     - investigate if node connections can be operated on separately from the node headers
-  - Allow insertion/deletion within connection table
-  - Allow inerstion/deletion within header table
-  - maintain free list of connections and headers
- separate node functionality from drawing the nodes
-   - pull node position, size, etc out into a parallel data structure. after split names: node_header, interface_node
-   - create separate files: foldhaus_node_engine, foldhaus_node_gui
-   - store interface_nodes in binary tree
-   - allow panning and zooming around the node canvas
-   - Investigate why we're giving nodes bounds :NodesDontNeedToKnowTheirBounds 
- selector node (has a list of connections that it can switch between)
- Serialize Nodes
- evaluation step (one node at a time)

Hardening
- turn the default sculpture view into an operation mode ? (have to think about this)
- Then we want to think about separating out mode render functions from mode update functions. Not sure its necessary but having something that operates like an update funciton but is called render is weird. Might want some sort of coroutine functionality in place, where modes can add and remove optional, parallel
update functions
- memory visualization
-  - Log memory allocations
- separate rendering thread
- cache led positions. Only update if they are moving
-  - shift drag to 10x drag speed

UI Improvements
- highlight node field under active edit
- Mouse Held Commands
- Actual cursor states
- Text editing improvements
-   - draw cursor in node field under active edit
-   - better/intelligent zero padding

API Improvements

Application
- More efficient HSV <-> RGB
- Save and load a session
- Don't render if the window isn't visible

Development
- Fix your scope time tracker to account for threads.
- Nest scope times so you can see totals/dig in

Interface
- fullscreen
- In world interface elements
-   - Handles for Patterns
-   - UI Popups
-   - Value modifiers
- Scroll view
- Update the text system - use system fonts

Structure
- motion

Renderer
- Render layers
- Mouse Picking - point at a led and see info about it
- Camera: pan
- Camera: zoom
- Camera: leds always face camera

Resource Management
- TODO: Need to figure out which textures are currently in graphics memory and which need to be resubmitted
- Icons

Animation
- timeline
- create clips that play
- clips can have parameters that drive them?
- clips should have prerequesites
-  - channels active
-  - patterns active in the channel
-  - when a clip is playing, it should just take over the whole structure

Command Line
- select a channel/pattern

Optimization
- investigate the memory access pattern of the SACN / LED systems. Guessing they are very slow
- look into why debug logging functions seems to incur a large hit on framrate
- patterns are asking to be multithreaded
- probably want to convert as much color functions to use u32 Packed Colors
-  - Probably want to think about this more. What about supporting different color depths
-    for different output devices?

Name
- Splash screen (like blender) (thisll be fun)
-  - Image importer (stb image? or find a png > bmp converter for the image you have)
-  - Display on startup
