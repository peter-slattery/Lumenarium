Intermediate Lifetime Memory & Operations
x Intermediate lifetime memory arena
- Temporary memory region = a multi frame operation
- Concept of an operation - temporary memory + interface command registry
- Allow one operation at a time at first
- Push/pop operations on a list?
- Current Operations:
-   - View Sculpture
-   - View/Edit Nodes
-      x Add Node (needs nesting)
-   - View SACN

- Why does backspacing in text entry not save when you close and reopen the node lister?

Plan
x start with adding nodes
x   push/pop an operation
x   create operation structure
x   static size of operations list
x   move command registry out of search lister and text entry into operation
x   initialize/cleanup add node operation
- extend to other operations

Hardening
- memory visualization
- separate rendering thread
- cache led positions. Only update if they are moving
x input context changes
-  - shift drag to 10x drag speed
- select nodes -> delete nodes
- remove node connections

Name
- Splash screen (like blender) (thisll be fun)
-  - Image importer (stb image? or find a png > bmp converter for the image you have)
-  - Display on startup

/Debug
x Make debug scope tracking thread safe - was throwing an error in stringsequal but that stopped. 
x    Keep an eye out.

Application
- More efficient HSV <-> RGB

- Save and load a session
-  - Serialize Nodes
- Don't render if the window isn't visible

Development
- Fix your scope time tracker to account for threads.
- Nest scope times so you can see totals/dig in
- Log memory allocations

Interface
- fullscreen
- In world interface elements
-   - Handles for Patterns
-   - UI Popups
-   - Value modifiers
- Scroll view
- Update the text system - use system fonts

Switch To Nodes
x basic node elements
-   - evaluation step (one node at a time)
-   - selector node (has a list of connections that it can switch between)
- serialize
- delete nodes

Structure
- motion

Renderer
- Mouse Picking - point at a led and see info about it
- Camera: pan
- Camera: zoom
- Camera: leds always face camera

Resource Management
- TODO: Need to figure out which textures are currently in graphics memory and which need to be resubmitted
- Icons

Animation
- timeline
- create clips that play
- clips can have parameters that drive them?
- clips should have prerequesites
-  - channels active
-  - patterns active in the channel
-  - when a clip is playing, it should just take over the whole structure

Command Line
- select a channel/pattern

Optimization
- patterns are asking to be multithreaded
- probably want to convert as much color functions to use u32 Packed Colors
-  - Probably want to think about this more. What about supporting different color depths
-    for different output devices?
