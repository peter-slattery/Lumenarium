LUSIO Light festival

- kids love this thing "THATS THE COOLEST"
- conversation about "People probably haven't talked about their covid experience yet, this is really good."
- "This is the most peaceful I've felt in a long time"
- "Where are you from" - "I'm from the one that's full of light"
- Rando: "Hey close the door, its way better."
- "A whole new world"
- "Want to do it with me?" (goes on to correctly explain the piece without us having told her)
- "So you're inside the globe, that's why it's inside out, THAT'S SO COOL!"
- "So that question was about feeling represented in government." "OH WOW - holy shit brazil!" (chorus)
- "Come do the thing!" "Wait, in front of everybody?"
- "It's kind of temple-y, with the writing and atmosphere and stuff"


TODO:

- Plasma Ray - light from primary city out to secondary splash
x Connection Pattern - fill part up with light, have the empty space do the data flow pattern
- Spatially Vertical Rain (not spherical)
- Something like rain for data viz

- Rendering gifs to the secondary cities


Anyone Home
- some light, but low power mode
- blues, match screen - guide person towards display

Welcome Home 
- keep the secondary cities off

Felt Isolated - blues, cooler tones, water?

Nature - gold, pink/purple - drinking champagne - carousel colors
- bluring the ends of bars is ok, just keep it consistent

For data sets that have really high values everywhere, grow them in one at a time
- for connection based ones: grow first, ripple out secondary cities to the next nearest primary city, grow that one

QUESTION: Are we showing a statement about the data during the passive mode of each scene?
- Yes

QUESTION: Can we change the scene ids? Does it matter if two screens have the same sceneId?

TODO: Put together an ending scene
