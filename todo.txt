TODO FOLDHAUS

Name
x lumen lab
- Splash screen (like blender) (thisll be fun)
-  x Create Image
-  - Image importer (stb image? or find a png > bmp converter for the image you have)
-  - Display on startup

/Debug
x Make debug scope tracking thread safe - was throwing an error in stringsequal but that stopped. 
x    Keep an eye out.

Application
- More efficient HSV <-> RGB

x Load/Unload sculptures
-  - Make sure that we offload unloading until after all jobs are completed. Otherwise they'll try and write
-    to data that doesn't exist
- Save and load a session
-  - Serialize Channels
-  - Serialize Patterns
- Don't render if the window isn't visible

Development
- Fix your scope time tracker to account for threads.
- Nest scope times so you can see totals/dig in
- Log memory allocations

Interface
- fullscreen
- In world interface elements
-   - Handles for Patterns
-   - UI Popups
-   - Value modifiers
- Scroll view
- Update the text system - use system fonts

Switch To Nodes
x basic node elements
-   - evaluation step (one node at a time)
-   - search nodes by name
-   - selector node (has a list of connections that it can switch between)
- serialize
- delete nodes

Structure
- motion

Renderer
- Mouse Picking - point at a led and see info about it
- Camera: pan
- Camera: zoom
- Camera: leds always face camera

Resource Management
- TODO: Need to figure out which textures are currently in graphics memory and which need to be resubmitted
- Icons

Animation
- timeline
- create clips that play
- clips can have parameters that drive them?
- clips should have prerequesites
-  - channels active
-  - patterns active in the channel
-  - when a clip is playing, it should just take over the whole structure

Command Line
- select a channel/pattern
- Channel: Add/remove pattern by name
- Channel: Set Blend Mode
- Channel: Set Current Pattern
- Pattern: Edit parameter values

Optimization
- patterns are asking to be multithreaded
- probably want to convert as much color functions to use u32 Packed Colors
-  - Probably want to think about this more. What about supporting different color depths
-    for different output devices?
