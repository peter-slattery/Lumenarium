    Overview:

        Shader program 'sloth_viz':
            Get shader desc: sloth_viz_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: sloth_viz_vs

                Uniform block 'sloth_viz_vs_params':

                    Bind slot: SLOT_sloth_viz_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: sloth_viz_fs
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader sloth_viz = sg_make_shader(sloth_viz_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'sloth_viz_vs':

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'sloth_viz_vs_params':
