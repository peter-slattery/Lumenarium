BUGS
x if there is nothing in the filtered list when searching for a node, hitting enter still selects one

Intermediate Lifetime Memory & Operations
x Intermediate lifetime memory arena
x Temporary memory region = a multi frame operation
x Concept of an operation - temporary memory + interface command registry
x Allow one operation at a time at first
x Push/pop operations on a list?
- Current Operations:
-   - View Sculpture (this might be an exception since its so central)
-     x View/Edit Nodes
-        x Add Node (needs nesting)
-     x View SACN
x make modes work with hot code reloading: rather than do the whole series of initialize command registry,
x   and manually adding each command, store the commands as an array, and auto iterate over them when you
x   push the mode on the mode stack
x decided I don't like storing NodeRenderSettings in each operation mode. Probably want to put it back in   x   app_state

/Debug
x Make debug scope tracking thread safe - was throwing an error in stringsequal but that stopped. 
x    Keep an eye out.

Switch To Nodes
x basic node elements

Hardening
x input context changes
